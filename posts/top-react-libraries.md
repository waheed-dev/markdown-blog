React has been dominating Javascript and web for long and rightly so.
With many great features and community support to do just about anything React has it all from building web application to mobile apps.

below are some of my favorite libraries

1. Next.js
2. Redux Toolkit
3. Chakra Ui


1. #React frameworks

## Next.js

**_The React Framework
for Production_**

Next.js has truly taken over React with its hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.

Next.js is also great for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) since its rendering HTML on the server and then sending it to the client. This pre-rendering allows search engine crawler to get all the HTML from the server.

**Honorable mentions**

- Remix.js
- Gatsby.js

2. # State management

## Redux Toolkit

**_The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development_**

A predictable, standalone state container for JavaScript apps which helps you write applications that behave consistently and run in different environments. where you can describe your UI as a function of your state and make Redux keep track of your components state and update them accordingly in response to UI actions.

Redux is definitely the most popular choice when it comes to state management with React with almost 5 million weekly downloads on NPM.

Redux Toolkit is the new standard way to write Redux logic. It eliminates around 1/4 boilerplate that was required with vanilla Redux no more having to define hundreds of files for each action.

**Honorable mentions**

- Zustand
- Recoil
- MobX

3. # Component Library

## Chakra Ui

**_Create accessible React apps with speed_**

Chakra ui is a React Component library.  Chakra UI uses CSS-in-JS under the hood ( emotion + styled-system ), which gives you access to style props – which are a 10x boost in productivity and the docs are very detailed and very well documented. 

All components are dark mode compatible by default and are also themeable. Chakra UI supports responsive styles out of the box. Instead of manually adding @media queries and adding nested styles throughout your code, Chakra UI allows you to provide object and array values to add mobile-first responsive styles.

 What I personally like about Chakra Ui that its so easy to use and customize I’ve used about every component library out there for react. Chakra is by far my favorite and go to.

**Honorable mentions**

- Material Ui
- Mantine
- AntD
